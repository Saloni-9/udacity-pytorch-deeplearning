PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source Python framework from the Facebook AI Research team used for developing deep neural networks. I like to think of PyTorch as an extension of Numpy that has some convenience classes for defining neural networks and accelerated computations using GPUs. PyTorch is designed with a Python-first philosophy, it follows Python conventions and idioms, and works perfectly alongside popular Python packages
